# Dante
An agent for interacting with our PostgreSQL database.

Project name is inspired by Dante Alighieri and his poem [Inferno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)), where dark & deep paths of hell correspond to database records.

Motivation for the agent is to both provide a common API for various clients, e.g. site, mobile app, dashboard and form a security layer as interaction with database will be permitted only through the agent.
